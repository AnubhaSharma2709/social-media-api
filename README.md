## Files Overview 📁

### `serializer.py`

This file contains the implementation of serializers used in the project. Serializers are a crucial part of Django Rest Framework, responsible for converting complex data types, such as Django models, into Python data types that can be easily rendered into JSON.

### `urls.py`

The `urls.py` file defines the URL patterns for the Django application. It includes the configuration for various endpoints and uses the Django Rest Framework router to manage viewsets.

### `views.py`

This file contains the implementation of API views and viewsets. It utilizes the Django Rest Framework to define views for handling HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

### `permissions.py`

The `permissions.py` file defines custom permission classes used in the project. These classes control access to different resources based on user permissions.

Feel free to explore the codebase to understand the implementation details and learn more about building REST APIs with Django and Python.
